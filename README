Project by Ashraf Shaikh (implemented server) and Ben Simon (implemented client)

How to run:
$make

For execution, in two terminals;
(Make sure to run the server first)
In one terminal:
$./server localhost
Or
$./server 127.0.0.1
Or
$./server <your.I.P.address>
Eg:
$./server 192.168.0.5 

In separate terminal:
./client localhost
(IP addresses concepts similar to server)

All 992 bytes will be sent automatically and remapped perfectly
